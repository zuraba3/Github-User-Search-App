## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout, page responsiveness and app functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes

## My process

1.Change background color of body.
2.Create search.
3.Create the card to display information.
4.Style all the elements.
5.Use Github API.
6.Add media queries for responsivnes.
7.Add Javascript and use Axios to take and display user's information.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript
- Github API
- Axios

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a lot of practise of using Media Queries and create responsive websites. Also it was realy good to practise using more SCSS properties. With this and other tools I gained a lot of experience and I wrote the SCSS code using mobile first approach, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites responsive. This was the first time when I have worked with API so the main challenge was to use Github APi and take the user's information, then to display it on the screen.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects.
